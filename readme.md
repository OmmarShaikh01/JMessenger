# Android Messaging Client (JMessenger)

## **Introduction:**
---
Chatting is a method of using technology to bring people and ideas together despite geographical barriers. The technology has been available for years but its acceptance was quite recent. This project is a chat client. This project is made up of 2 components i.e. the chat client running on Android and the encrypted Firebase servers. Messaging clients globally used currently don’t provide admin access to the chatrooms created on the server.

 Public servers have it flaws as it doesn’t provide complete access over the data being shared and also we need to share out personal data with the service providers. This is a major security and privacy concern. Data privacy is the most important  factor  to consider when a  solution  is  developed  for personal use  as  a messaging  client. JMessenger is a free and open-source, cross-platform, cloud-based, a centralized instant messaging app. Its messaging client is for managing and operating on privately hosted Firebase servers chatrooms tailored according to the specific use cases.


## **Objectives:**
---
- **Authentication:** App users should have the possibility to create a personal account. The wise idea is to implement a user sign-up option in one click via social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). For increased security, it is possible to interconnect with the device with the help of confirmation SMS.

- **Access To Contacts:** For enhanced user experience, your messaging app should automatically access to existing user contacts and get them imported to the messaging app. A strategic step is to highlight for end-users which contacts already use this messenger and give an option to invite those that still don’t.

- **Exchange Messages:** Users need to have the possibility to exchange files, videos, photos, and other content. Therefore, to make sure that the messaging app supports different app attachments. This feature can be implemented by using distinct APIs.

- **Push Notifications:** It is an essential element in any messaging app development. It is the function that allows the user to check whether someone sends a message or not.

- **User Satisfaction:** To generate user satisfaction and get user retention, your application needs to be customizable. The users do like the idea of playing with app interfaces, themes, and colours to make it more personalized and attractive.
